# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

This project was completed as part of my Data Analysis Internship at **SaiKet Systems**.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To analyze customer churn patterns in a telecommunications company and build a predictive model to identify customers likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 🧠 Key Tasks
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized churn rates by demographics, contract types, and payment methods.  

3. **Churn Prediction Model**  
   - Built a Logistic Regression model and evaluated it using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.  

4. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Proposed data-driven retention strategies targeting high-risk customer segments.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Results
- Logistic Regression model achieved **XX% accuracy**
- Identified key churn factors: contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and payment method.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
